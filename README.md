# flutter_midi_command_web

Federated Flutter plugin for Web platform implementing the interface from the [flutter_midi_command_platform_interface](https://github.com/InvisibleWrench/flutter_midi_command_platform_interface)

## Getting Started

Until this plugin is endorsed by the main [FlutterMidiCommand plugin](https://github.com/InvisibleWrench/FlutterMidiCommand) you will need to include both the interface and this plugin as dependencies, please see the example app in this repo for how to do this.
